## Wealth Wise Vision Statement

The Wealth Wise App will help users track their income, expenses, and savings whilst also providing tips as to how they can improve their spending habits. The app will help users to improve their financial literacy, stay mindful of their spending habits, and offer an easy-to-use tracking tool. By making financial tracking simple, fun, and engaging the app aims to promote better financial decisions for all people at all incomes levels.  

The app is primarily designed for budget conscious people who want to reach their financial goals like saving for travel, tuition, property, retirement, and more. Users will be able to log and categorize their financial activities right when they happen or whenever it is convenient for them. With Wealth Wise the user will be able to stay on top of their financial activities by reviewing their history and adjusting their habits as needed. They can also set savings goals and track their expenses so they can better meet their goals. The app provides a financial summary, breaks down spending categories (e.g. needs, wants, savings), and gives tips so that users can improve their financial patterns.

WealthWise will be accessible to anyone, as long as they sign up and create a secure profile with their own username and password. They can review their past spending and saving patterns and get a complete overview of their finances. The user's personal data will remain private, and it will only be visible to the logged in user.

The system simplifies the process of tracking income, expenses, and savings, which will give users a better picture of their financial status. This will allow users to make much wiser decisions and hopefully help to reduce their financial stress. The Wealth Wise app is built in-house, and will be offering free and customizable tools making it more accessible and better suited than other apps currently on the market.

Wealth Wise will be a valuable tool since it helps people to easily manage their money and make better decisions regarding their financial activities. Many people struggle to track their spending, save enough, and make smart financial choices amidst the growing pressures and uncertainty of our economy. The app helps to solve this problem by categorizing spending and showing people exactly where their money is going. It will be helpful to set savings goals and users can accurately stay on track to reach them, through this fun and customizable app. Wealth Wise will be simple to use, open to everyone, useful at any income level, and helpful in guiding users to a better financial future.

The project will be considered successful if the majority of all users prefer this system over other, similarly functioning applications available in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, and if reports show an average increase of 10% in savings across all users.
The project will be considered successful if it results in improved financial habits and gains user approval, which will be determined by survey. The app will help users to reach the 50/30/20 baseline goal (50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings), or any other acceptable goals they set if they adjusted this baseline. Additionally, the app's ability to attract and maintain users will also be a key indicator for its success.
